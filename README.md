# NASSCOM_VSD_SOC_DESIGN_PROGRAM
Opensource RTL to GDS2 implementation on OpenLane

## Sky130 Day 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK (March/26/2025 - March/27/2025)

### SKY130_D1_SK1 - How to talk to computers

* Any embedded system will have chips. The chip is present in the **Package** to make it easy to mount on a embedded board and handling. Connections to the chip is done by various packaging methods, common among which is **Wire Bound** method
* Zooming into the chip itself, there is **I/o clearing** for placing I/O pads and **core area**. Both of these are sitting inside the **Die area**. The **wire Bound** connections attch to the i/o pad for the chip to communicate with outside.
* **Foundary** manufactures  the chips and can also provide **IP's (Intellectual Properties)** in the form of soft or hard macros to be used inside the design
* ISA is **Instruction Set Architecture** is asm code acting as last human readable code before its converted to machine code
* typical flow {C code > complied to ASM > assembler to machine code}
* The RTL code is used to model the hardware that will run the ISA.

### SKY130_D1_SK2 - SoC design and OpenLANE
* we require the following enablers to be readily available as open-source versions for open-source ASIC design implementation. They are as below
    1. RTL Designs
    2. EDA Tools
    3. PDK Data
* ASIC Implementation takes a lot of steps and openlane achieves this by pulling together the tools that enable each step
* Typical flow is as follows:
   1. Synthesis: Maps RTL to physical library from a PDK and gives us netlist defined with devices for that design. In other words during this stage the RTL (Register Transfer Level) code is converted to ( Verilog format) optimized Gate level netlist.
   2. Floorplan & Powerplan: Die size, pin placement and power scheme are set during this stage
   3. Place: Std cells are placed inside the core region
   4. CTS: All seq elements receive clock connection from clock tree generation
   5. Routing: Signal connections are done
   6. Signoff: The design is checked for DRC, LVS, timing issues. GDS is generated
 
## LAB : SKY130_D1_SK3 - Get familiar to open-source EDA tools

* Enter the dir `~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane` all openlane runs must happen from this directory.
* the design folder `~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/design` holds the data for RTL2GDSII implementation, we focus on `picorv32a`. the `config.tcl` inside the designs have the highest priority and the cmds mentioned in them override the default commands in the tools
* To open the openlane instance:
  ```bash
  docker
  # calls the docker instance for the openlane
  ./flows.tcl -interactive
  # opens openlane terminal
  package require openlane 0.9
  # calls openlane 0.9
  prep -design picorv32a
  # prepares Picorv32a design for implemtation
  ```

* after this `runs` dir willbe created in the `designs/picorv32a` folder
  ![Screenshot from 2025-03-27 14-10-38](https://github.com/sowrabh-adiga/NASSCOM_VSD_SOC_DESIGN_PROGRAM/blob/main/files/Screenshot%20from%202025-03-27%2014-10-38.png)
* inside the run directory the folders will be created as the runs are done
  ![run dir](https://github.com/sowrabh-adiga/NASSCOM_VSD_SOC_DESIGN_PROGRAM/blob/main/files/Screenshot%20from%202025-03-27%2014-51-16.png)
* there is one `config.tcl` which is diffrent from the other config file discussed before, this one shows which default parameters are being taken bt=y the runs
* Running synthesis:
  ```bash
  run_synthesis
  # runs synthesis and abc's
  ```
* after the run we can check the run dir for the results, logs and reports. `results` folder must have the synthesized netlsit. `reports` folder will have all the reports for synthesis step and `logs` will store all the run logs for synthesis. in the `reports` chronologically latest report is most accurate 
  ![runs folder content](https://github.com/sowrabh-adiga/NASSCOM_VSD_SOC_DESIGN_PROGRAM/blob/main/files/Screenshot%20from%202025-03-27%2015-15-59.png)

* At this step we need to do DFF ratio calculation as follows:
```math
Flip Flop\ Ratio = \frac{Number\ of\ D\ Flip\ Flops}{Total\ Number\ of\ Cells}
```
```math
Percentage\ of\ DFF's = Flip Flop\ Ratio * 100
```
* checking for latest file we have `reports/synthesis/1-yosys_4.stat.rpt` from dir image above. Therefore Flip Flop ratio is:
```math
Percentage\ of\ DFF's = \frac{1613}{14876} * 100 = 10.84 %
```
* we can also analyse the sta reports along with the yosys usage summary
  

## Sky130 Day 2 - Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

### SKY130_D2_SK1 - Chip Floor planning considerations

* Floorplanning: defining the dimesions of a chip
* assume unit width and height of std cells and FF's then taking all of them together, gives us the abs min area required to place the cells inside a core area
* below are the most important concepts for floorplan definition: 
```math
Utilization = \frac{Area\ utilized\ by\ netlist}{Total\ core\ area}
```
and 

```math
Aspect\ Ratio= \frac{Heigth of core}{Width of core}
```
* with abs min area known, we need to account for area occupied by routing metals.
## (March/28/2025)
* **Preplaced cells concept** : top level logic is broken into mutiple cuts and are implemented separately
* The circuits implemented in such a way can be black boxed and the design can be used multiple times, like an IP block
* Memory, complex clock gating cells, mux, comparators, ALUâ€™s can be designed in such a way
* These cells are placed and fixed before the std cell placement and the tool doent alter the placement of these pre-placed cells
* we need to surround the preplaced cells with decoupling  cells
  
* **decoupling  cells** help maintain stable supply voltage across the logic they are placed near , by provding capacitive charging effect in the event of supply voltage drop due to reistance on the pwr supply path
* **pwr planning**: Having single pwr supply point results in voltage drop in larger circuits, this results in signal integrity issues. To solve this pwr meshes are spread throughout the design to have a very small path from pwr supply to logic devices.
* **Pin Placement** requires knoledege of the design, how pins interact with cels inside the design.
## LAB : floorplan and placement
* `:~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/configuration` contains the tool default configurations and `README.md` filde inside that folder lists all the diffrent config variables avaible for the designer
* priority : `:~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/configuration` < `design/runs/config.tcl` < `design/PDK.tcl`
```bash
  run_floorplan
  # run floorplan

```math
Width\ in\ unit\ distance = 660685 - 0 = 660685
```
```math

```
```math
Area\ of\ die\ in\ microns = \frac{660.685 * 671.405}{1000 * 1000} = 443587.21\ Microns^2
```

* we can view the floorplan generated with the help of `magic` tool
```bash
# in a seperate terminal enter the directory with def filr (results folder in recent run stage : floorplan)

* in `magic` gui to center the design for better viewing when in  the gui press "s" and "v", "s" is to select an object (entire design in this case)
* to zoom into a location: left click mouse for lower (x1,y1) and right mouse click for setting (x2,y2)
* keep the cursor on the object whose info is needed, then press "s" to select and then in tkconsole write cmd "what"

### SKY130_D2_SK2 - Library Binding and Placement

* **Library**: contains diffrent flavours of cells, timing, functionality informations
* Placing the netlist elements in core area from floorplan stage is **placement**
* When the placement is done its wrt the pin placement, estimated resistance, capacitances of the interconeects . signal Transition analysis is done to see if the placed cells are recievin the signals on time, if not buffers are added to improve the transition.

### SKY130_D3_SK3 - Sky130 Tech File Labs (March/31/2025)
#### ngspice sim for cell characterization

* After the cell layout is created we need to do characterization (timing , noise)
* timimng characterization is sone after extracting the device parasitics and R,C and running simulatioms
* here for inv cell we do transient analysis to find rise , fall transition, cell delay  

### LAB
* To create spice deck from spice file obtained from magic GUI , we need to add some extra commands tp spice
      1. add lib paths were the pmos,nmos are modeled
      2. add the proper grid dimension
      3. check if the correct name is used for pmos, nmos moidels
      4. Add signal, pwr, gnd connections to the circuit connections
      5. define analaysis type and specify the parameters for simulation

## Sky130 Day 4 - Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree : SKY130_D4_SK1 - Timing modelling using delay tables

### April/2/2025
*Tmimng table is used to model delay of a cel wrt to input transition and output load
* To insert the custom design (`sky130_vsdinv` in this course )into openlane flow, we need the characterised lib and lef

we can see the connectivity by selcting the `sky130_vsdinv` instance by keeping cursor  over it and pressing 's'. To see teh connections enter the cmd `expand` in tkconsole of `magic`

```tcl
expand
```

### SKY130_D4_SK2 - Timing analysis with ideal clocks using openSTA
#### April/03/2025

* *setup analysis*  refers to he minimum time a data signal must be stable before the active clock edge to ensure proper data capture by a flip-flop
* *Clock Jitter* refers to the deviation of a clock signal's edges from their supposed ideal clock edge
* *Clock uncertainity* encompasses all sources of timing variation, including jitter and other factors like skew and process variations.
* Uncertainity values are introduced in slack calculation of setup and hold slack to introduce more pessimisim to the design activity.

### Lab to config the tool to run opensta post synthesis
create `pre_sta.conf` to define the files to be loaded to the opensta for analysis in diffrent corners
![](https://github.com/sowrabh-adiga/NASSCOM_VSD_SOC_DESIGN_PROGRAM/blob/main/files/Screenshot%20from%202025-04-03%2014-46-10.png)
create `mybase.sdc` file to define timimng contraints info for the sta tool. place it in `designs/picorv32a/src`
![](https://github.com/sowrabh-adiga/NASSCOM_VSD_SOC_DESIGN_PROGRAM/blob/main/files/Screenshot%20from%202025-04-03%2014-39-17.png)
now run the opensta tool
```bash
sta pre_sta.conf
```
the analysis will be done and the results will be printed in the terminal

#### Lab:  Optimization
*Reopen the openlane to implemmemt any changes
```bash
docker

./flow.tcl -interactive

package require openlane 0.9

prep -design picorv32a -tag 03-04_09-49 -overwrite

# Adiitional commands to include custom lef to openlane flow
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3" 

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT
set ::env(SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT) 4

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis
```
open new sta cmdline in new terminal
```bash
sta pre_sta.conf
```

Nand gate of strength 2 is driving three cells
* changing drive stenght to 3 returns the message "Warning: liberty cell 'sky130_fd_sc_hd__nand2_3' not found."
* changing the drive strenght to 4

OAI cell of drive strenght 2 has more delay:
* changing drive stenght to 3 returns the message "Warning: liberty cell 'sky130_fd_sc_hd__o21bai_3' not found."
* changing the drive strenght to 4
![](https://github.com/sowrabh-adiga/NASSCOM_VSD_SOC_DESIGN_PROGRAM/blob/main/files/Screenshot%20from%202025-04-03%2016-43-17.png)
The slack reduced from -4.5555 to -4.5060
![](https://github.com/sowrabh-adiga/NASSCOM_VSD_SOC_DESIGN_PROGRAM/blob/main/files/Screenshot%20from%202025-04-03%2016-43-30.png)

to check the timimg through a cell we changed
```tcl
report_checks -from _35312_ -to _35239_ -through _22380_
# report_checks -from _start_pont_net_id -to end_point_net_id -through cell_id
```

### writin the ecos to new netlist

keep the old netlist in different name
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/03-04_09-49/results/synthesis/

mv picorv32a.synthesis.v picorv32a.synthesis_old.v
```
 
Now write the new netlist in the opensta terminal

```tcl
write_verilog  write_verilog ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/03-04_09-49/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis.v
```
After this stage rerunning synthesis will erase all the good changes done in opensta tool. so after `write_verilog` cmd we can return to openalne cmdline and run

```tcl

#if "run_floorplan" command gives error, following cmds do the same
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or

# Now we are ready to run placement
run_placement

# With placement finished , run CTS
run_cts
```
After the cts , new .v file is creted in the synthesis results folder

### Sky130 Day 5 - Final steps for RTL2GDS using tritonRoute and openSTA
3 steps are done here:
* PWR Routing : due to how openlane is structured pwr routing is done at this stage, normally PDN is created during floorplan stage
* signal routing withh triton route
* Rc extraction
* OpenSTA for post route timing analysis

PWR Routing:
```tcl

# check which def file openlane is currently pointing at , it should be pointing to CTS def
echo $::env(CURRENT_DEF)

# create PDN
gen_pdn
```
pdn.def generated
![](https://github.com/sowrabh-adiga/NASSCOM_VSD_SOC_DESIGN_PROGRAM/blob/main/files/Screenshot-45.png)
view the pdn with 
```bash

cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/04-04_09-02/tmp/floorplan
